class SequentialDistributedSampler(torch.utils.data.sampler.Sampler):
    """
    Distributed Sampler that subsamples indicies sequentially,
    making it easier to collate all results at the end.
    Even though we only use this sampler for eval and predict (no training),
    which means that the model params won't have to be synced (i.e. will not hang
    for synchronization even if varied number of forward passes), we still add extra
    samples to the sampler to make it evenly divisible (like in `DistributedSampler`)
    to make it easy to `gather` or `reduce` resulting tensors at the end of the loop.
